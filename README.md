This is just a simple tutorial purpose app

**NOTE**
its better to mention full path in Image asset like:   

AssetImage('assets/images/dice-png-$rightDiceNumber.png')

otherwise if you metion like:  

AssetImage('images/dice-png-$rightDiceNumber.png')

then this will work fine on browser but will cause error in emulator.
